= Color from Bitmap : Inkscape extension

== brief

Grab color from underlying bitmap and apply it to path objects.
The color is averaged all over the path area. Erode parameter can be used
to shrink or expand (using negative value) this area.
If multiple bitmaps are selected, only one is considered.

**Known limitations:**

- Only works on embedded image.
- Only consider a single image.
- Only handle path objects: does not work on rectangles, circles, ... Make sure to convert objects to paths.
- Only works with straight paths: bezier area are approximated using straight lines.
- Dilatation (negative erosion) have weird corners.
- Ignore any clipping on the image.
- slow
